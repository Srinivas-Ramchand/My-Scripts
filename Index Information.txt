Few points about indexes

1. **Indexes**:
- B-tree structures are commonly used for creating indexes.

2. **Two Types of Indexes**:
- There are clustered indexes and non-clustered indexes.

3. **Levels of Indexes**:
- Indexes typically have three levels: root, intermediate, and leaf levels.
- Data is stored in the leaf level.

4. **Intermediate Index Level**:
- The intermediate level contains keys that guide the search to the leaf level.

5. **Heap Tables**:
- A table without a clustered index is referred to as a heap.

6. **Creating Clustered Index**:
- To create a clustered index, a primary key is not mandatory, but it's often a common practice to use the primary key as the clustered index key.

7. **Automatic Creation of Clustered Index**:
- If a primary key is defined on a table, a clustered index is created by default, but you can choose to create a non-clustered primary key.

8. **Non-Clustered Index Creation**:
- Non-clustered indexes can exist alongside clustered indexes.

9. **Composite Index**:
- An index created on multiple columns is called a composite index.

10. **Covering Index**:
- A covering index includes all the columns required to satisfy a query, thus avoiding a need for additional lookups.

11. **RID Lookup**:
- To avoid RID (Row Identifier) lookup, you would create a clustered index on the table.

12. **Number of Indexes**:
- There can be one clustered index per table.
- The number of non-clustered indexes that can be created on a table varies by database system but is generally more than 999.

13. **Clustered Index in WHERE Condition**:
- If a query uses a key column from a clustered index in the WHERE condition, it may perform a clustered index seek.

14. **Query Optimizer and Undefined Column**:
- If an index is not defined on a column used in a query, the query optimizer may suggest a clustered index scan.

15. **Non-Clustered Index Seek with WHERE Condition**:
- Using non-clustered index (NI) columns in the SELECT list and in the WHERE condition may lead to a non-clustered index seek.
