IMPORTANT TRACE FLAGS

TRACE FLAG 1117

TF 1117 forces all data files on each database to grow uniformly. Whenever data file grows uniformly, I/O will be better, and it improves the speed of read and write operations in SQL Server.

Trace Flag 1117: Tempdb database data file grows with all files at the same time so each of them remains on an equal size.

Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and upper versions this trace flag is implemented as a default setting for the tempdb database.


TRACE FLAG 3226

If you notice the SQL error log there would be lots of backup success messages which gets saved. Sometimes we really donâ€™t need all the success messages for backup. 
For example, consider the log shipping scenario. Hence, we have TF 3226 which avoids writing success messages into your error log.


TRACE FLAG 2371

Whenever huge volume of changes happens on SQL tables, the internal process automatically calls statistics to update all the changes.
 During this time your query must wait to build the new execution plan. If you enable TF 2371, the query need not wait till statistics update gets completed.
